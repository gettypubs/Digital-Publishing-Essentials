## GitHub Key Concepts & Training

### Key Concepts

- GitHub is a project management site that uses git for version control
- GitHub projects are called *repositories*
- A GitHub repository is a folder of files
- And just like a folder on your computer, a GitHub repository can include any kind of file, in any kind of file structure
- A repository can be two or more places at once (*clones*), and two or more versions (*branches*) at once
- This means you can have a repository on your computer and work in it just like you would any other folder, but GitHub tracks what's going on and synch's your copy with copies elsewhere.
- GitHub remembers each set of changes (each *commit*) made to a repository, and allows you to go back and undo those changes (*revert* the commit) anytime.

### Learning Resources

**[GitHub Guides—Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)**: A very quick guide to some of the key parts of GitHub workflow and terminology. There are other [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com) covering a variety of topics, and they all tend to be quite user friendly.

**[Lynda.com—GitHub for Web Designers](http://www.lynda.com/GitHub-tutorials/GitHub-Web-Designers/162276-2.html)**: Not just for desigers, this Lynda.com course is recommended as a comprehensive not-overly-technical guide to the site. (*Getty staff have free access to the course through the [e-Learning Portal](http://elearn.getty.edu).*)

**[Beginner's Guides to Git](http://cheryltino.github.io/Github-for-Publishers/2015/beginners-guide/)**: A list of other resources about git and GitHub, selcted and compiled by @cheryltino as part of a summer internship here at Getty Publications. Enjoy!

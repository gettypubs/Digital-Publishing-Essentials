### Machine-Readable Code Markup

```
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>
```

In the future, we may further integrate machine-readable CC licensing information, as suggested at [https://github.com/creativecommons](https://github.com/creativecommons/mp/blob/master/doc/platform-toolkit.mdwn).

**[GitHub Guides—Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)**: A very quick guide to some of the key parts of GitHub workflow and terminology. There are other [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com) covering a variety of topics, and they all tend to be quite user friendly.

**[Lynda.com—GitHub for Web Designers](http://www.lynda.com/GitHub-tutorials/GitHub-Web-Designers/162276-2.html)**: Not just for desigers, this Lynda.com course is recommended as a comprehensive not-overly-technical guide to the site. (*Getty staff have free access to the course through the [e-Learning Portal](http://elearn.getty.edu).*)
